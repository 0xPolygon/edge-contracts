# The Hardhat config is configured to recognize 4 chains: a production root/child, and a
# test root/child. To run on any of them, put a URL to an RPC in the proper field. For
# example, if you are using Alchemy and need to fork Ethereum mainnet as the root chain, 
# you would put the complete URL (including API key) in the ROOT_RPC.

# If you are running a local node, use a URL to localhost, for example:
# http://localhost:8545
